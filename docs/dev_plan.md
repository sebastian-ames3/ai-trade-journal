AI Trader / Journal â€” Execution Plan & Templates (2025-10-01)

## Objectives

- Reboot the codebase with professional structure and quality gates.
- Ship via small PRs with test coverage and explicit change control.
- Reduce regression risk when chat context resets.

## Branching & Flow

- `main` = stable
- `feat/<slug>`, `fix/<slug>`, `docs/<slug>`
- PRs must include tests and CHANGELOG updates.

## Required Return Format (from ChatGPT)

1. Rationale
2. Unified diff patch for edited files
3. New files as separate blocks
4. Test plan & commands
5. Migration notes
